    <p>Welcome to the most fun role in the game, and the most <strong>bullied one.</strong> This is a role that many have tried but only a few have lived through to tell the stories of it.</p>

    <p>As a jungler I don't like to admit it, but, ADC players need stronger nerves to deal with being really weak early and left on their own from the start very often.</p>
