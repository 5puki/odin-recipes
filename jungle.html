    <p><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9erLsEHAZRI&ab_channel=PeppeSpampy" target="_blank" ref="noopener noreferrer">Welcome to the Jungle.</a></em> I simply cannot talk about this role without being a bit biased, so please don't judge if I overexaggerate something in this article.</p>
    <p>This role is made for people who enjoy 5D chess. It takes a lot of patience and planning ahead in order to make this role work in high percentage. However, you will also need <strong>nerves of steel</strong> as well, as you will be blamed for every mistake your team makes. Stay strong mentally!</p>
